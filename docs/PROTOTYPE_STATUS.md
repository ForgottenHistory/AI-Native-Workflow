# Multi-Agent Architecture System - Prototype Status

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** Phase 1-3 VALIDATED (Static Flow Working)
**Next:** Dynamic Orchestrator Implementation

---

## What We Built

### Phase 1: Architect ⟷ Coder Dialogue (VALIDATED ✅)

**File:** `orchestrator_stateful.py`

**Implementation:**
- Two separate `ClaudeSDKClient` instances (Architect + Coder)
- Sequential conversation with message passing
- Each agent maintains independent reasoning chain
- Consensus detection via "CONSENSUS:" and "AGREED:" markers

**Results:**
```
Conversation: conversation/stateful_session_20251015_022645.md (790 lines)
Turns: 4 (Architect → Coder → Architect → Coder)
Outcome: Consensus reached
Quality: Architecture measurably improved through dialogue
```

**Evidence of Success:**
- Architect initially proposed: 70KB budget, "optional" form validation, no accessibility mention
- Coder challenged: "too optimistic", required validation, flagged missing accessibility
- Architect revised: 150KB budget, validation required, accessibility first-class
- **Conclusion: Multi-agent dialogue produces better architecture than single agent**

### Phase 2: Documentation Synthesis (VALIDATED ✅)

**File:** `test_docs_agent.py`

**Implementation:**
- Docs agent reads full conversation transcript
- Extracts decisions, rationale, trade-offs, constraints
- Outputs markdown following templates
- Saves to `architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `architecture/CONSTRAINTS.md`

**Results:**
```
ARCHITECTURE.md: 15KB (11,907 chars)
  - Tech stack decisions with rationale
  - Design decisions with alternatives considered
  - Performance targets (specific numbers)
  - Trade-offs accepted (what we gave up for what)
  - Implementation effort estimate
  - Migration path

CONSTRAINTS.md: 14KB (13,636 chars)
  - NEVER/ALWAYS/SHOULD rules
  - Performance budgets (<250KB total, <50KB JS, <150KB images)
  - Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA, score ≥95)
  - Technology constraints (allowed/forbidden)
  - Testing requirements
  - Validation checklist
```

**Evidence of Success:**
- Docs accurately captured conversation reasoning
- Preserved "why" behind decisions
- Made constraints testable (specific numbers, check commands)
- Format is clear and actionable

### Phase 3: Implementation from Docs (VALIDATED ✅)

**File:** `test_implementation.py`

**Implementation:**
- Coder agent reads `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `CONSTRAINTS.md`
- Makes autonomous decisions about implementation approach
- Uses Write tool with permission callback (`allow_code_writes`)
- Creates complete project in `code/` directory

**Results:**
```
Files created: 18
  - Configuration: package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js
  - Source: src/App.tsx, main.tsx, index.css
  - Components: Hero.tsx, Features.tsx, ContactForm.tsx, DarkModeToggle.tsx
  - Hooks: useDarkMode.ts
  - Assets: index.html, public/favicon.svg
  - Deployment: vercel.json, README.md, .gitignore, .env.example

Build status: SUCCESS (npm install && npm run dev works)
Visual quality: "looks pretty good" (user confirmed)
```

**Evidence of Success:**
- Agent made good autonomous decisions (file structure, implementation order)
- Followed ARCHITECTURE.md exactly (Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Followed CONSTRAINTS.md (no RHF/Zod, system fonts, simple validation)
- **Complete, working, runnable implementation from synthesized docs**

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Challenge 1: Windows CLI Length Limits
**Problem:** Multi-line system prompts break Windows shell (SDK passes as CLI args)
**Solution:** Keep system prompts concise (<500 chars), single-line format

### Challenge 2: Emoji/Unicode Encoding on Windows Console
**Problem:** Windows console (cp1252) crashes on emoji/special Unicode
**Solution:** Strip non-ASCII characters for console output, preserve in saved files
```python
def strip_unicode(text: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c if (ord(c) < 128 or c in '\n\r\t') else '' for c in text)
```

### Challenge 3: Docs Agent Trying to Use Tools
**Problem:** Docs agent tried to use Write tool instead of outputting markdown
**Solution:** Explicit prompts: "DO NOT use tools. OUTPUT markdown text directly."

### Challenge 4: SDK Write Permissions
**Problem:** SDK blocked Write tool by default for security
**Solution:** Permission callback allowing writes only to `code/` directory
```python
async def allow_code_writes(tool_name, input_data, context):
    if tool_name in ["Write", "Edit"]:
        file_path = input_data.get("file_path", "")
        if file_path.startswith("code/"):
            return PermissionResultAllow()
        return PermissionResultDeny(message="Can only write to code/")
```

### Challenge 5: Agent Confusion About Dialogue Context
**Problem:** Agents said "I don't see the message" when message was present
**Solution:** Updated agent definitions with "Critical Understanding" sections explaining they're in direct dialogue

## Current System Architecture

### Static Flow (What We Have)

```
User Input: test_project.md
    ↓
[orchestrator_stateful.py]
    ↓
Phase 1: Architect ⟷ Coder Dialogue
  - initialize_agents()
  - run_dialogue() (4 hardcoded turns)
  - save_conversation()
    ↓
Phase 2: Documentation Synthesis
  - initialize_docs_agent()
  - synthesize_documentation()
  - Saves: ARCHITECTURE.md, CONSTRAINTS.md
    ↓
Phase 3: Implementation
  - Coder reads architecture docs
  - Autonomous implementation
  - Writes 18 files to code/
    ↓
Output: Working code + documentation
```

### Agent Roles (Implemented)

**Architect Agent:**
- System prompt: Software architect proposing tech stacks
- Signals: "CONSENSUS:" when finalizing
- Reads: Project requirements
- Writes: Architectural proposals (via conversation)

**Coder Agent:**
- System prompt: Implementation engineer evaluating feasibility
- Signals: "AGREED:" when satisfied
- Reads: Architectural proposals + ARCHITECTURE.md + CONSTRAINTS.md
- Writes: Code (Phase 3), evaluation feedback (Phase 1)

**Docs Agent:**
- System prompt: Documentation synthesizer extracting from conversations
- Reads: Conversation transcripts + templates
- Writes: ARCHITECTURE.md, CONSTRAINTS.md (structured markdown)

## Validation Results

### Success Criteria (from multi_agent_prototype_guide.md)

**Minimum Viable Prototype:**
- ✅ Two agents have actual dialogue (not just sequential execution)
- ✅ Agents challenge each other's ideas
- ✅ Reasoning is better than single-agent (more options explored)
- ✅ Architecture is documented before implementation
- ✅ Conversation → Docs → Code flow works

**What Good Looks Like:**
- ✅ Architect asks clarifying questions (not just designs immediately)
- ✅ Coder challenges impractical suggestions
- ✅ Both explore trade-offs
- ✅ Consensus emerges through dialogue (not dictated)
- ✅ Decisions are clear
- ✅ Rationale is documented
- ✅ Trade-offs are explicit
- ✅ Alternatives are noted
- ✅ Architecture is better than you would design alone
- ✅ Architecture is better than single-agent would design
- ✅ Reasoning is preserved
- ✅ Implementation path is clear

**Build Quality:**
- ✅ Code builds without errors
- ✅ Code matches ARCHITECTURE.md decisions
- ✅ Code follows CONSTRAINTS.md rules
- ✅ Visual quality acceptable ("looks pretty good")

## Known Limitations

### Static Workflow
**Issue:** Hardcoded sequence (Dialogue → Docs → Implementation)
**Impact:** Cannot handle:
- Implementation failures requiring architecture revision
- Iterative refinement loops
- Conditional agent invocation
- Dynamic task routing

**Example:**
```
Current: Always runs all 3 phases sequentially
Needed:  If implementation fails → return to Architect with specific issue
         If architecture invalid → Audit flags violations
         If docs drift → Docs updates
```

### No Feedback Loops
**Issue:** No mechanism to return from later phases to earlier phases
**Impact:** Cannot learn from implementation failures to improve architecture

### No State Management
**Issue:** No persistent project state tracking
**Impact:** Cannot resume from interruption, must restart entire flow

### No Dynamic Decision Making
**Issue:** No orchestrator deciding which agent to run next
**Impact:** Cannot adapt to project state, always runs same sequence

### No Audit Agent
**Issue:** No mechanical validation of constraints
**Impact:** Constraint violations may slip through

## Future Work

### Immediate (Next Session): Dynamic Orchestrator

**Goal:** Replace static flow with intelligent orchestration

**Requirements:**
- Read project state (what files exist, what's done)
- Decide which agent to run next based on state
- Handle feedback loops (implementation → architecture)
- Know when to ask human for input
- Adapt to results

**Implementation Approach:**
```python
class DynamicOrchestrator:
    async def assess_state(self):
        """What files exist? What's been done? What's needed?"""

    async def decide_next_action(self, state):
        """Which agent should run? With what inputs?"""

    async def execute_action(self, action):
        """Run selected agent, capture results"""

    async def handle_failure(self, failure):
        """Loop back to appropriate phase with feedback"""

    async def check_completion(self):
        """Are we done? What's left?"""
```

**Decision Logic:**
```
State: No architecture docs
  → Action: Run Architect ⟷ Coder dialogue

State: Dialogue consensus, no docs
  → Action: Run Docs synthesis

State: Docs exist, no code
  → Action: Run Coder implementation

State: Implementation failed
  → Action: Run Audit, then return to Architect with violations

State: Code exists, docs stale
  → Action: Run Docs update

State: Human feedback
  → Action: Return to appropriate phase with context
```

### Phase 4: Audit Agent

**Purpose:** Mechanical validation of CONSTRAINTS.md

**Inputs:**
- CONSTRAINTS.md (rules to check)
- Recent changes (code, architecture)
- Performance budgets

**Outputs:**
- AUDIT_LOG.md (violations, warnings, compliance checks)
- Pass/fail decision

**Validation:**
- Bundle size checks
- Dependency validation
- Performance budget compliance
- Constraint consistency

### Phase 5: Test on Multiple Projects

**Goal:** Validate robustness across domains

**Test Cases:**
- CLI tool (different from web app)
- REST API (backend focus)
- Dashboard (data visualization)
- Different complexity levels

**Document:**
- What works consistently
- What breaks (edge cases)
- Failure modes
- Required guardrails

### Phase 6: Medium Complexity Project

**Goal:** Find scale limits

**Scope:** 2k-5k lines of code, multiple subsystems

**Questions:**
- Where does it break?
- What additional structure needed?
- How to maintain consistency at scale?

## Cost Analysis

### Per-Run Costs (Approximate)

```
Phase 1 - Dialogue (4 turns, ~5k tokens/turn):
  Cost: ~$0.30

Phase 2 - Docs Synthesis (2 documents, ~25k context):
  Cost: ~$0.27 ($0.10 + $0.19)

Phase 3 - Implementation (20 file writes, ~25k context):
  Cost: ~$0.21

Total per complete run: ~$0.78
```

### Usage Notes
- Uses Claude Pro/Max subscription (not API credits)
- Pro: ~10-40 prompts per 5 hours
- Max: 5x-20x higher limits
- Full prototype run: ~6-10 prompts (fits in limits)

## Key Learnings

### What Worked

1. **Separate `ClaudeSDKClient` instances create genuine dialogue**
   - Each agent has independent reasoning chain
   - Agents genuinely challenge each other
   - Consensus emerges naturally

2. **Explicit "DO NOT use tools" prompts work**
   - Docs agent outputs markdown instead of trying to write files
   - Prevents tool permission issues

3. **Permission callbacks enable safe file writes**
   - Can restrict agent to specific directories
   - Allows autonomous implementation

4. **Templates guide output quality**
   - ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md → structured decisions
   - CONSTRAINTS_TEMPLATE.md → testable rules

5. **Conversation → Documentation → Implementation flow is valid**
   - Each layer builds on previous
   - Reasoning is preserved
   - Implementation matches architecture

### What Didn't Work

1. **Nested `ClaudeSDKClient` contexts hang**
   - Cannot run agents concurrently
   - Must run sequentially

2. **Multi-line system prompts break Windows CLI**
   - SDK passes prompts as command-line arguments
   - Must keep prompts concise

3. **Sub-agents don't maintain state**
   - Each invocation is fresh context
   - Cannot use for multi-turn dialogue

4. **Hardcoded turn limits are inflexible**
   - Currently max_turns=5 for dialogue
   - May need more for complex discussions

### Surprises

1. **Agent autonomy exceeded expectations**
   - Coder created sensible file structure without explicit instructions
   - Docs agent preserved nuance from conversation
   - Quality of generated code was high

2. **Dialogue quality is genuinely better than single agent**
   - Measurable improvement (budget revision, accessibility)
   - Not just role-playing, actual reasoning improvement

3. **Documentation synthesis works remarkably well**
   - Captured "why" behind decisions
   - Organized information clearly
   - Made constraints testable

## Decision Log

### Why Sequential Agents (Not Concurrent)?
**Decision:** Run agents one at a time, not simultaneously
**Reason:** SDK doesn't support concurrent `ClaudeSDKClient` instances (hangs)
**Trade-off:** Slower execution, but necessary for stability
**Alternative Considered:** Parallel execution (not feasible with current SDK)

### Why Permission Callbacks (Not Open Write Access)?
**Decision:** Use `can_use_tool` callback to restrict writes to `code/` directory
**Reason:** Security - prevent accidental writes to system files
**Trade-off:** Slight complexity, but necessary for safe autonomous operation
**Alternative Considered:** Open access (too dangerous), no tools (too limited)

### Why Output Markdown for Docs (Not Use Write Tool)?
**Decision:** Docs agent outputs markdown as text, orchestrator saves it
**Reason:** Simpler, avoids permission issues, easier to debug
**Trade-off:** Orchestrator must save files, but more reliable
**Alternative Considered:** Let Docs use Write tool (hit permission issues)

### Why Static Flow First (Not Dynamic Orchestrator)?
**Decision:** Build hardcoded Dialogue → Docs → Implementation flow first
**Reason:** Validate core concept before adding complexity
**Trade-off:** Inflexible, but proves methodology works
**Alternative Considered:** Build dynamic orchestrator first (too complex, risk of failure)

### Why Consensus Markers (Not AI Decision)?
**Decision:** Use "CONSENSUS:" and "AGREED:" text markers to detect consensus
**Reason:** Simple, explicit, easy to detect programmatically
**Trade-off:** Agents must remember to use markers, but works well in practice
**Alternative Considered:** AI analyzes conversation for consensus (too complex, less reliable)
